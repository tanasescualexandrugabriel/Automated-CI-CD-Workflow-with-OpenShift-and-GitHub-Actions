Automated CI/CD Workflow with OpenShift and GitHub Actions
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions and OpenShift. By combining the automation capabilities of GitHub workflows with the scalable and reliable infrastructure of OpenShift, this project aims to streamline the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and ensure high-quality deliverables.

The pipeline automates key processes such as code linting, testing, deployment, and cleanup, minimizing manual effort and reducing errors. It is designed to support modern development practices, providing developers with immediate feedback and enabling faster delivery of features to end-users.
